This my solution for Unit 7: Lab 4 "Pauper's REDDIT" in the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# API LAB: Pauperâ€™s REDDIT

### Task: 
Create a webpage that displays the posts from the AWW Subreddit.

### Build Specifications:
- Use a model or a controller to request data from the https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/.json API.
- Display the results on the page.
- At a minimum, include a title, image and working link for each post. (Easiest is to use the thumbnail for the image, but there are other images in the JSON response.)

### Extended Exercise:
- Only show the first ten results.
- Use Some CSS to pretty up the page, either the built in bootstrap or your own CSS
- Write code to search for other Reddit APIs (Hint: They all have the same structure)
